# gstar

An R package to help you analyze data using method Generalized Space-Time Autoregressive, this method is great to analyze multivariate time series data with spatial effect.

## Getting Started
This package is still beta version, if you want to install it you can use ```devtools:install_github('zaenalium/gstar')```.
Please be noted that this package is build based on this following paper :

* Budi Nurani Ruchjana, Svetlana A. Borovkova and H. P. Lopuhaa (2012), *Least Squares Estimation of Generalized Space Time AutoRegressive (GSTAR) Model and Its Properties*, The 5th International Conference on Research and Education in Mathematics AIP Conf. Proc. 1450, 61-64

I have seen a lot of derivative or enhancement of this method (eg. gstarima, gstar-x), if you need those derivative to be included in this package please help me find the reference and I will include it.
Also please contact me if there is a bug in this package. I really appreciate if you help me to give more reference or check my coding.
